Scoreboard for pool games

This app keeps score when you're playing pool. Simply tapping the score increases the score on the given side. The additional circle indicator indicates whose break it is, altering after each point.

Additionally, tapping a player name allows you to change the name.

## Additional functionalities

Icons in the top bar from left to right:

* Undo: Revoke latest given score 
* Reset: Resets the score back to 0:0 
* Sound: Toggle the silly text-to-speech feedback when awarding points
* Switch: Manually assign the break to the other player 
* Fullscreen: Request the browser to go fullscreen 
* Timer: Turn on shot timer 
* Finish: Will reset scores to 0:0, but increase the overall match scores (top-middle)

## Timer usage

Tapping the button with the number allows assigning the shot time from where shot time starts. After each point, the timer will reset and start counting down immediately. Additionally, with the remaining two buttons, you can manually start or stop the timer.
